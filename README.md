# Personal-Blog-Updates

This personal blog was created to keep track of responses on my very own blog.

##Usage

This project can be used as a tracker to create lists of payroll data salaries.

##Features

The form on the first page gathers the user, title, and content of information added to the blog.  

When you submit the form, data is stored to localStorage.  

The second page allows you to keep track of the information submitted.

You are able to toggle between a dark and light background.  You also have the capability to return back to the initial page to submit an additional comment to the blog.
